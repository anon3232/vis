# Variationally Inferred Sampling

This repository contains the code for the experiments for the UAI submission "Variationally Inferred Sampling Through a Refined Bound for Probabilistic Programs". Instructions inside each model .py file.

## Dependencies

* Make sure you have a working Python 3 environment. We recommend you to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

* After that, you need to install PyTorch. This course is based on PyTorch 1.2, which is the most stable version at the time of this writing. You can install from [here](https://pytorch.org/)

* Some of the experiments require also to install [jax](https://github.com/google/jax/) or [funsor](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/funsor/)
